# Lib.AspNetCore.ClientHints

Lib.AspNetCore.ClientHints is a library which provides support for set of HTTP request header fields, colloquially known as Client Hints, to address a need to deliver optimized content for each device to ASP.NET Core.

## Documentation

There is a blog post available describing implementation details and usage basics:

## Donating

My blog and open source projects are result of my passion for software development, but they require a fair amount of my personal time. If you got value from any of the content I create, then I would appreciate your support by [buying me a coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/tpeczek).
